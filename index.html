      <h2 id="h2">Timeline of Monroe's life:</h2><br>
      <ul>
        <li><h3><u>1926-1943</u>: Childhood and first marriage</h3><p>Monroe was born as Norma Jeane Mortenson on June 1, 1926. Monroe's mother was unprepared for a child, so she was living with foster parents and in orphanage also. In 1942, after her 16th birthday, she married James Dougherty who enlisted in the Merchant Marine, in order to avoid going back to the orphanage. She dropped out of highschool and became a housewife.</p></li>
        <li><h3><u>1944-1948</u>: Modeling and first film roles</h3><p> Monroe started to work at the Radioplane Company. She met photographer David Conover and in  1945 she quit her job and started modeling for him. She was more suitable for pin-up than high fashion modeling. To make herself more employable, she straightened her hair and dyed it blonde. She was featured mostly in advertisements and mens magazines. In 1946 she was given a screen-test by Ben Lyon a 20th Century-Fox executive. She was given a contract and her and Lyon selected the stage name 'Marilyn Monroe'. In the same year she divorced Dougherty, who was against her career. In 1947 she was given her first role in <i>Dangerous Years (1947.)</i> and <i>Scudda Hoo! Scudda Hay! (1948.)</i> .</p></li>
        <li><h3><u>1949-1952</u>: Breakthrough years</h3><p>She was given smaller roles during these years, including in these two films <i>All about Eve (1950.)</i> and <i>The Asphalt Jungle (1950.)</i>. In 1951 she had roles in three successful Fox comedies: <i>As Young As You Feel, Love Nest,</i> and <i>Let's Make It Legal</i>. In 1952 she started dating Joe DiMaggio a retired baseball star. Fox released three of her films: <i>Clash by Night, Don't Bother to Knock,</i> and <i>We're Not Married!</i>. Because of her anxiety and chronic insomnia she started to use barbiturates, amphetamines and alcohol, but she didn't become severely addicted until 1956.</p></li>
    <li><h3><u>1953</u>: Rising star</h3><p>Monroe starred in three movies that were released in 1953: <i>Niagara, Gentlemen Prefer Blondes,</i> and <i>How to Marry a Millionaire</i>. Monroe's position as a leading sex symbol was confirmed in December 1953, when Hugh Hefner featured her on the cover in the first issue of <i>Playboy</i>. </p></li>
    <li><h3><u>1954-1955</u>: Conflicts with 20th Century-Fox and second marriage</h3><p>Monroe had become one of 20th Century-Fox's biggest stars,  but her contract had not changed since 1950, she was paid far less than other stars. In 1954 the studio head executive suspended Monroe when she refused to begin shooting yet another musical comedy, <i>The Girl in Pink Tights</i>. On January 14. she married Joe DiMaggio. Monroe settled with Fox in March, with the promise of a new contract, a bonus of $100,000, and a starring role in <i>The Seven Year Itch</i>. In this year there were also other films released: <i>River of No Return,</i> and <i>There's No Business Like Show Business</i>. After only nine months of marriage she filed for divorce.</p></li>
    <li><h3><u>1956-1959</u>: Third marriage</h3><p> In 1956 she married Arthur Miller who was a playwright. In the same year her film <i>Bus Stop</i> was released. In 1957 she bought Greene's share of the company because of their disagreements on MMP. In 1958 she got a role in <i>Some Like It Hot</i>.</p></li>
    <li><h3><u>1960-1962</u>: Personal difficulties</h3><p>In 1959 she starred in the musical comedy <i>Let's Make Love</i> and was released in 1960. The last film that Monroe completed was <i>The Misfits</i>. In 1961 she divorced Miller. Monroe returned to the public eye in the spring of 1962 and began shooting a film for Fox, <i>Something's Got to Give</i>. Besides her medical issues she took a break from filming to sing 'Happy Birthday Mr.President' on stage at President John F. Kennedy's early birthday celebration. Fox fired Monroe and sued her for $750,000 in damages because of having another film running behind the schedule. To repair her public image, Monroe engaged in several publicity ventures, including interviews and her first photo shoot for Vogue. For Vogue, she and photographer Bert Stern collaborated for two series of photographs, one a standard fashion editorial and another of her posing nude, which were published with the title <i>The Last Sitting</i>.</p></li>

  <h2>Death</h2>
  <p>During her final months, Monroe lived at 12305 Fifth Helena Drive in the Brentwood neighborhood. Monroe's sudden death was front-page news in the United States and Europe. In the following decades, several conspiracy theories, including murder and accidental overdose, have been introduced to contradict suicide as the cause of Monroe's death.</p>
  
  <h2>Legacy</h2>
  <p>Hundreds of books have been written about Monroe. She has been the subject of films, plays, operas, and songs, and has influenced artists and entertainers.  She also remains a valuable brand: her image and name have been licensed for hundreds of products, and she has been featured in advertising for brands such as <i>Max Factor, Chanel, Mercedes-Benz,</i> and <i>Absolut Vodka</i>. Monroe's enduring popularity is linked to her conflicted public image. On the one hand, she remains a sex symbol, beauty icon and one of the most famous stars of classical Hollywood cinema. On the other, she is also remembered for her troubled private life, unstable childhood, struggle for professional respect, as well as her death and the conspiracy theories that surrounded it. </p>
